# House-Price-Prediction

This is a House Price Prediction application built with Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and a Linear Regression model for predicting house prices. The application takes inputs such as location, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and square feet to estimate the price of a house.

# Features

User-Friendly Interface: A simple and clean web interface where users can enter house details.

Location-Based Prediction: The model considers location as one of the factors in predicting house prices.

Real-Time Prediction: Predict house prices instantly with the "Predict Price" button.

Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes.

# Technologies Used

Machine Learning Model: Linear Regression 

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)

Deployment: Run locally or on any server that supports Flask

# How It Works

Model Training: The model is trained using Linear Regression on a dataset that includes various factors affecting house prices.

Prediction Logic: Once trained, the model can predict house prices based on user inputs (location, BHK, bathrooms, and square feet).

Flask Web Application: Flask is used to connect the model with the frontend and serve the web interface to users.
